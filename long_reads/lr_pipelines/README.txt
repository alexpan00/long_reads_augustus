Examples to show how the long read pipelines, FLAIR and Isoseq3 were run.
All the data used was downloded from ENCODE. For the PacBio data the subreads
were downloded. For the ONT data the fastq files were downloaded.

The initial part of the PacBio data processing has to be done with the Isoseq3
pipeline.
